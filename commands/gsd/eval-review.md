<arguments>$ARGUMENTS</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

**Project selection:** if the arguments include `--project <name>`, the user is targeting the named project in `.planning/<name>/`. In the first shell command you run for this command (once `gsd_run` is defined), run `gsd_run query project.set <name>` and stop if it fails; then treat the remaining arguments as if `--project <name>` were absent. The selection holds for the rest of the session, including subagents.

<objective>
