<arguments>$ARGUMENTS</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

**Project selection:** if the arguments include `--project <name>`, the user is targeting the named project in `.planning/<name>/`. In the first shell command you run for this command (once `gsd_run` is defined), run `gsd_run query project.set <name>` and stop if it fails; then treat the remaining arguments as if `--project <name>` were absent. The selection holds for the rest of the session, including subagents.

<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit handoff
- Resume instructions
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/pause-work.md
</execution_context>

<context>
State and phase progress are gathered in-workflow with targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
If `--report` is in the `<arguments>` block:
Read and execute `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/session-report.md` end-to-end.

**Follow the pause-work workflow**.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
</process>
