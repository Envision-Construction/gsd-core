<arguments>$ARGUMENTS</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

**Project selection:** if the arguments include `--project <name>`, the user is targeting the named project in `.planning/<name>/`. In the first shell command you run for this command (once `gsd_run` is defined), run `gsd_run query project.set <name>` and stop if it fails; then treat the remaining arguments as if `--project <name>` were absent. The selection holds for the rest of the session, including subagents.

<objective>
Create a clean branch suitable for pull requests by filtering out .planning/ commits
from the current branch. Reviewers see only code changes, not GSD planning artifacts.

This solves the problem of PR diffs being cluttered with PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md
changes that are irrelevant to code review.
